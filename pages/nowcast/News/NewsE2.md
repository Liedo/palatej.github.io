### Example 2: Updating German GDP
This second example is identical to the previous one. The same explanations apply. We simply look at a different variable, German GDP growth. In this case, the contribution of the various indicators at updating German GDP is different than in the previous example, even if both updates are generated simultaneously with the same model.
