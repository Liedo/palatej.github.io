# {{page.description}}

The R language is widely used among statisticians and data analysts. Here we describe an R interface that will allow R users to access the state-space functionalities of JDemetra+. This interface can be used to develop and estimate models that can be written in a [general state-space form](../overview/index.html). In order to use this package, one needs to save it and install the rjava package, which enables the connection between R and Java. 


## Quick steps to define a model

- Install rJava
- Install our package
- Go directly to the [examples](make link)

## Content of the package

1. Functions to specify the transition equation
2. Functions to specify the measurement equation
3. Algorithms
4. Examples
