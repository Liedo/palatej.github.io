# {{page.description}}

The Kalman filter provides in a readily way the forecasts of ARIMA models.

More especially, we represent in JD+ an [ARIMA model](../../ssf/implementations/arma_ssf.md) by the following state vector ($s=\max \left( p-1,q \right)$):

$$ \alpha_t= \begin{pmatrix} y_t \\ y_{t+1|t} \\ \vdots \\ y_{t+s|t} \end{pmatrix}$$  

where $y_{t+i|t}$ is the orthogonal projection of
$y_{t+i}$ on the subspace generated by ${y\left(s\right):s \leq t}$.Thus, it is the forecast function with respect to the semi-infinite sample.

At the end of the filtering process, the state vector contains the first $s$ forecasts. The next forecasts ($k \gt s$) are computed recursively using the relationship:

$$ \Delta(B) \Phi (B) \hat y_{n+k} = 0 $$

##### Implementation

The exact ARIMA forecasts are implemented in the class `demetra.arima.internal.ExactArimaForecasts`.

The class uses the fast Chandrasekhar (CKMS) filter for better performances (which implies that the series should not contain missing values)
